## Installation

In order to run the project locally for development and testing, ensure that dependencies are installed by running:

`npm install`

## Usage

The application is an e-commerce platform designed initially with Context API before being refactored to work with Redux store. The application is a SPA site and the initial state is defined with the reducers folder. The aim of the project was to familiarize with the Redux documentation and apply it to the e-commerce application.
